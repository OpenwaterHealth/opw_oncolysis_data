# Openwater Preclinical Oncolysis Data
This repository contains _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ data from experiments with the system. The Openwater Preclinical Oncolysis Prototype is designed to help researchers investigate the effect of different ultrasound parameters on a variety of in vitro and preclinical in vivo targets. Certain acoustic parameters may be well suited for damaging cancer cells while sparing surrounding healthy tissue, and this system is designed to systematically explore such effects in a laboratory setting. 

For additional details on the preclinical oncolysis system and its applications, refer to the [wiki](https://wiki.openwater.health/index.php/Oncolysis).

An [overview of the experiments and results](Results_Overview.pdf) summarizes the key findings, while the [raw data](data) (where available) are also provided.
